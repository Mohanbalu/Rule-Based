# 🩺 Rule-Based Medical Diagnosis System  
### *An AI-Powered Expert System for Disease Prediction Based on Symptoms*  

---

## 🔍 Overview  

The **Rule-Based Medical Diagnosis System** is an **AI-driven expert system** that mimics the reasoning process of a human doctor.  
Using a **rule-based inference engine**, it analyzes a user’s symptoms and suggests possible diseases along with confidence scores, matched symptoms, and medical recommendations.  

This project demonstrates the principles of **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**, **Knowledge-Based Systems**, and **Expert Systems** — combining domain knowledge, logic, and reasoning.
